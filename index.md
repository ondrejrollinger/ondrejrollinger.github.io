# Ondřej Rollinger — Cybersecurity notes and portfolio

I’m an automotive software engineer expanding my knowledge and hands-on experience in cybersecurity. This site is my public notebook and portfolio.

I document what I build, test, and learn, with a strong focus on **repeatable, evidence-driven work**.

Most posts are practical (investigations, playbooks, small tools/scripts, lab projects). Some posts are theory companions (cryptography/protocol notes) written to support the practical work.

## What you’ll find here
- **Practice posts**: investigations, detection ideas, playbooks, lab projects, and automation
- **Theory companions**: cryptography/protocol concepts explained with worked examples and verification
- **Methodology**: how I structure investigations, validate conclusions, and publish safely

## Current focus
- Building the blog structure (navigation, tags, search, posting conventions)
- Setting up my home lab hardware and network visibility (segmentation/telemetry foundations)

## Portfolio standards (how I write)
Each post aims to show clear ownership:
- **What I built/changed** (config, script, diagram, lab setup)
- **What I ran** (commands, queries, tests — defensive only)
- **What I observed** (outputs, logs, metrics)
- **What I verified** (expected vs actual; success criteria)
- **Artifacts** are included as small snippets and are **sanitized** (sensitive identifiers replaced with consistent placeholders)

## AI assistance (disclosure)
I may use AI tools to assist with drafting and editing for clarity and consistency. The technical work, evidence selection, validation, and conclusions are mine.
