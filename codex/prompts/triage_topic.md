# Topic triage (inputs first, no writing yet)

You are preparing to write a cybersecurity portfolio post.

Do:
1) Restate the topic in one sentence (confirm what the post is about).
2) List required inputs in three tiers:
   - Minimum
   - Recommended
   - Advanced
3) Provide a copy/paste Case Brief template to fill in.
4) Stop and ask the user to provide the inputs.

Rules:
- Defensive framing only.
- Remind the user to provide only small excerpts (10–30 lines) and to redact sensitive identifiers.
- Optimize for proof of ownership: what was built, what was run, what was observed, what was verified.
