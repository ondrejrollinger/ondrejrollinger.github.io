- Four main types of risk assessment frequencies
  - Ad-Hoc Risk Assessments

## Conducted as needed, often in response to specific events or situations

## Address potential new risks or changes in existing risks

- Recurring Risk Assessments

## Conducted at regular intervals (e.g., annually, quarterly, monthly)

## Part of standard operating procedures for continual risk identification and

- Risk Identification
  - Crucial first step in risk management
  - Involves recognizing potential risks that could impact an organization
  - Risks can vary from financial and operational to strategic and reputational
  - Techniques

## Brainstorming

## Checklists

## Interviews

## Scenario Analysis

- Organization should consider a wide range of risks, including operational,
  financial, strategic, and reputational risks
- Document and analyze risks based on impact and likelihood
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

  - Monitors, implements mitigation actions, and updates Risk Register
  - Accountable for risk management

## Qualitative Risk Analysis

- Qualitative Risk Analysis
  - Primary method in risk management
  - Assesses risks based on potential impact and likelihood
  - Categorizes risks as high, medium, or low
  - Subjective and relies on expertise and experience
  - Avoids quantitative complexity
- Key Components
  - Likelihood/Probability

## Chance of risk occurrence

## Qualitatively expressed as low, medium, or high

## Based on past experience, statistical analysis, or expert judgment

- Impact

## Potential consequences if risk occurs

## Qualitatively rated as low, medium, or high

## Assess damage to project or business objectives

## Impact Levels

- Low Impact
  - Minor damage, essential functions operational
- Medium Impact
  - Significant damage, loss to assets
- High Impact
  - Major damage, essential functions impaired

## Quantitative Risk Analysis

- Quantitative Risk Analysis
  - Provides objective and numerical evaluation of risks
  - Used for financial, safety, and scheduling decisions
  - Utilizes key components

## Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

## Exposure Factor (EF)

## Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

## Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

- Key Components
  - Exposure Factor (EF)

## Proportion of asset lost in an event (0% to 100%)

## Indicates asset loss severity

- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

## Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event

## Calculated as Asset Value x Exposure Factor (EF)

- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

## Estimated frequency of threat occurrence within a year

## Provides a yearly probability

- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

## Expected annual loss from a risk

## Calculated as SLE x ARO

## Risk Management Strategies

- Four primary risk management strategies
  - Risk Transference

## Shifts risk to another party

## Common methods

- Insurance
- Contract indemnity clauses
  - A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover
    the other’s harm, liability, or loss stemming from the
    contract

## Doesn’t remove the risk

- Shifts the responsibility for handling the risk’s financial
  consequences
  - Risk Acceptance

## Acknowledge and deal with risk if it occurs

## Used when cost of managing the risk outweighs potential loss or risk is

unlikely to have a significant impact

## No actions to mitigate the risk are taken

## Methods

- Exemption (excludes party from a rule)
  - The organization doesn’t have to obey a specific rule or
    requirement
  - There is no risk of not complying with the rule or
    requirement
  - There may be a benefit or mitigation offered by the rule or
    requirement which exempted organizations won’t receive
    because they are exempt
- Exception (allows party to avoid rule under specific conditions)

## In both Exemption and Exception, the organization assumes risk either by

operating without the safeguards or mitigations offered by a rule
(exemption), or by operating in a way that lets them evade the risk
(exception).

- Risk Avoidance

## Change plans or strategies to eliminate a specific risk

## Chosen when the risk is too great to accept or transfer

- Risk Mitigation

## Take steps to reduce likelihood or impact of risk

## Common strategy involving various actions

## Risk Monitoring and Reporting

- Risk Monitoring
  - Process of

## Tracking identified risks

## Monitoring residual risks

## Identifying new risks

## Evaluating risk response plans

- Involves ongoing tracking of risks and their response actions
- Helps determine Residual Risk and Control Risk

## Residual Risk

- The likelihood and impact of the risk after mitigation,
  transference, or acceptance measures have been taken on the
  initial risk

## Control Risk

- Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over
  time
- Risk Reporting
  - Communicating information about risk management activities to stakeholders
  - Includes results of risk identification, assessment, response, and monitoring
  - Often presented in the form of a risk report
- Risk Monitoring and Reporting are essential for
  - Informed decision making
