    authorized personnel
  - Use access control vestibules to restrict entry to one person at a time
  - Maintain situational awareness to prevent unauthorized access
- Dumpster Diving
  - Attackers sift through garbage for discarded information
  - Employees with situational awareness can spot such activities
  - Dispose of sensitive data securely to avoid being a victim of this attack
- Operational Security (OPSEC)
  - Protects critical information from being used by adversaries
  - Safeguard sensitive data, daily routines, and internal procedures
  - Discourage sharing seemingly innocuous details on social media or during
    personal interactions
- Technological Social Engineering Attacks
  - Baiting attacks use removable media devices (e.g., USB thumb drives) and
    charging cables
  - Picking up or connecting found devices can infect workstations or networks with
    malware
  - Carry your own charging cables and chargers to avoid untrusted ones
- Pressure Tactics
  - Social engineers may use a sense of urgency or fear to manipulate individuals
  - Urgent requests aim to bypass normal security protocols
  - People are more likely to make mistakes when rushed into action
- Proactive Culture of Security
  - Train employees regardless of their position in the company
  - Educate on recognizing phishing attempts, data privacy, and safe online behavior
  - Encourage employees to report suspicious activities
  - Conduct practical exercises, like simulated phishing attacks, to test and remediate
    employees’ responses

- Top five tips for increasing your score on the exam
  - Use a cheat sheet

## You’re not allowed to actually carry anything into the exam with you, but

if you’re at a local testing center, they will give you a whiteboard or a dry
erase sheet that’s about the size of a normal piece of paper

## Once the clock starts on the exam, you can brain-dump anything you

want onto that paper

## Use the sheet and spend the first 1-2 minutes writing down those

important things you may forget later on

- Skip any questions that are giving you trouble

## If you find yourself struggling with a really hard question, just mark it for

review and skip it

## Students who do this end up increasing their score by at least 5% to 10%
over their peers who try to do the simulations at the beginning of their
exam

- Take a guess

## If you’re in doubt, take a guess from the possible answer choices

## There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly on the exam

## If you are in doubt of the right answer, try to eliminate as many choices as

possible and guess between the remaining answer options

- Pick the best time for your exam

## Pick the time of day that works best for you

## Don’t try to squeeze the exam in after working a long day at the office

- Be confident

## You’ve got this!

## You should already know you’re going to pass!

## You should have already studied all the information in this course, you’ve

watched the videos, you’ve taken the quizzes, you’ve studied your
downloadable study notes

## If you’re not confident right now, then wait a few days to schedule your

exam

## Take a bunch of practice exams and build up your confidence

- When you take a practice exam, your goal is not to memorize the answer key
  - You need to understand why the right answer was right and the wrong answers
    are wrong
- Good luck, and we hope to see you again in a future course as you continue upwards in
  your cybersecurity career and continue to climb the CompTIA certification ladder into
  CySA+, PenTest+ and CASP+!
