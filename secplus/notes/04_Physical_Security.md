Communication (NFC) for access

## Fencing and Bollards

- Fencing and bollards stand out as some of the most primitive tools that are employed to
  safeguard assets and people
- Fence
  - Structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts
  - In terms of physical security, fences serve several purposes

## Provides a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should not be

violated by unauthorized personnel

## Establish a physical barrier against unauthorized entry

## Effectively delay intruders which helps provide our security personnel a

longer window of time to react

- Bollards
  - Robust, short vertical posts, typically made of steel or concrete, that are
    designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic
- Fencing is considered to be more adaptable and well-suited for safeguarding large
  perimeters around the entire building
- Bollards are really designed to counter vehicular threats in a specific area instead

## Attacking with Brute Force

- Brute Force
  - Type of attack where access to a system is gained by simply trying all of the
    possibilities until you break through
- In terms of physically security, brute force focuses on the following
  - Forcible Entry

## Act of gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically breaking or

bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors, or fences

## Use high-strength doors with deadbolt locks, metal frames, or a solid core

- Tampering with security devices

## Involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that

can be exploited

## To protect against tampering with security devices, have redundancy in

physical security measures

- Confronting security personnel

## Involves the direct confrontation or attack of your organization’s security

personnel

## Security personnel should undergo rigorous conflict resolution and

self-defense training to mitigate risks

- Ramming barriers with vehicles

## Uses a car, truck, or other motorized vehicle to ram into the

organization’s physical security barriers, such as a fence, a gate, or even
the side of your building

## Install bollards or reinforced barriers to prevent vehicles from driving into

your facilities

## Surveillance Systems

- Surveillance System
  - Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given
    area
- Surveillance is often comprised of four main categories
  - Video Surveillance

## Can include the following

- Motion detection
- Night vision
- Facial recognition

## Remote access

## Provides real-time visual feedback

## A wired solution security camera is physically cabled from the device back

to the central monitoring station

## A wireless solution relies on Wi-Fi to send its signal back to the central

monitoring station

## Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) System

- Can move the camera or its angle to better detect issues during an
  intrusion

## Best places to have cameras

- Data center
- Telecommunications closets
- Entrance or exit areas

## Cameras should be configured to record what they’re observing

- Security Guards

## Flexible and adaptable forms of surveillance that organizations use

## Helps to reassure your staff or your customers that they are safe

- Lighting

## Proper lighting is crucial for conducting effective surveillance using both

video and security guards

## If you create well-lit areas, this can deter criminals, reduce shadows and

hiding spots, and enhance the quality of your video recordings

- Sensors

## Devices that detect and respond to external stimuli or changes in the

environment

## There are four categories of sensors

- Infrared Sensors
  - Detect changes in infrared radiation that is often emitted
    by warm bodies like humans or animals
- Pressure Sensors
  - Activated whenever a specified minimum amount of
    weight is detected on the sensor that is embedded into the
    floor or a mat
- Microwave Sensors
  - Detect movement in an area by emitting microwave pulses
    and measuring their reflection off moving objects
- Ultrasonic Sensors
  - Measures the reflection of ultrasonic waves off moving
    objects

## Bypassing Surveillance Systems

- Some of the different methods used by attackers to bypass your organization’s
  surveillance systems
  - Visual Obstruction

## Blocking the camera’s line of sight

## Can involve the following

- spraying paint or foam onto the camera lens
- placing a sticker or tape over the lens
- positioning objects like balloons or umbrellas in front of the
  camera to block its view
  - Blinding Sensors and Cameras

## Involves overwhelming the sensor or camera with a sudden burst of light

to render it ineffective for a limited period of time

- Interfering with Acoustics

## Acoustic systems are designed to listen to the environment to detect if

someone is in the area or to eavesdrop on their conversations

## Jamming or playing loud music to disrupt the microphone’s functionality

- Interfering with Electromagnetic

## Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

- Involves jamming the signals that surveillance system relies on to
  monitor the environment
  - Attacking the Physical Environment

## Exploit the environment around the surveillance equipment to

compromise their functionality

- Physical tampering, like cutting wires or physically disabling devices, is an effective
  strategy to bypass surveillance systems
- Modern systems are equipped with countermeasures to help protect surveillance
  systems

## Access Control Vestibules

- Access Control Vestibules
  - Double-door system that is designed with two doors that are electronically
    controlled to ensure that only one door can be open at a given time
- These access control vestibules can also help prevent piggybacking and tailgating
  - Piggybacking

## Involves two people working together with one person who has

legitimate access intentionally allows another person who doesn’t have
proper authorization to enter a secure area with them

- Tailgating

## Occurs whenever an unauthorized person closely follows someone

through the access control vestibule who has legitimate access into the
secure space without their knowledge or consent

- The key difference between Piggybacking and Tailgating

## Piggybacking uses social engineering to gain consent of the person with

legitimate access

## Tailgating doesn’t use or obtain the consent of the person with legitimate

access.

- Access control vestibules are usually integrated with electronic badges and operated by
  a security guard at the entrance to a secure facility or office building
  - Badges contain

## RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)

## NFC (Near-field Communication)

## Vulnerable to simple techniques like lock picking

- Modern Electronic Door Locks

## Utilize various authentication methods for enhanced security

## Authentication Methods

- Identification Numbers
  - Require entry of a unique code, providing a balance of
    security and convenience
- Wireless Signals
  - Utilize technologies like NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or RFID for
    unlocking
- Biometrics
  - Rely on physical characteristics like fingerprints, retinal
    scans, or facial recognition for authentication
  - Biometric Challenges

## False Acceptance Rate (FAR)

- Occurs when the system erroneously
  authenticates an unauthorized user
- Lower FAR by increasing scanner sensitivity

## False Rejection Rate (FRR)

- Denies access to an authorized user.
  Increasing sensitivity can increase FRR

## Crossover Error Rate (CER)

- A balance between FAR and FRR for optimal
  authentication effectiveness
- Some electronic door locks use multiple factors, such as an identification number and
  fingerprint, to increase security
- Cipher Locks
  - Mechanical locks with numbered push buttons, requiring a correct combination
    to open
  - Commonly used in high-security areas like server rooms
- Secure entry areas in office buildings, often using electronic access systems with badges
  and PINs for authentication

## Access Badge Cloning

- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) are popular
  technologies used for contactless authentication in various applications
- Access Badge Cloning
  - Copying the data from an RFID or NFC card or badge onto another card or device
- How does an attacker clone an access badge?
  - Step 1: Scanning

## Scanning or reading the targeted individual’s access badge

- Step 2: Data Extraction

## Attackers extract the relevant authentication credentials from the card,

such as a unique identifier or a set of encrypted data

- Step 3: Writing to a new card or device

## Attacker will then transfers the extracted data onto a blank RFID or NFC

card or another compatible device

- Step 4: Using the cloned access badge

## Attackers gain unauthorized access to buildings, computer systems, or

even make payments using a cloned NFC-enabled credit card
