- **Provides**: Actual security

**Analogy**: 
- Algorithm = Lock design (everyone knows how it works)
- Key = Unique key that opens the lock (only you have it)

---

### Key Strength and Security

#### **Key Length** 📏
- **Relationship**: Longer key = More security
- **Why**: More possible combinations to try (brute force)

**Common Key Sizes**:
- **Symmetric**: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit (AES)
- **Asymmetric**: 2048-bit, 3072-bit, 4096-bit (RSA)

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption

### **Symmetric Encryption** 🔐

**Definition**: Uses SAME key for both encryption and decryption

**Also Called**: Private key encryption, secret key encryption

**How It Works**:
```
Alice encrypts with Key-X → Sends ciphertext → Bob decrypts with Key-X
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ **FAST**: Much faster than asymmetric
- ✅ **Efficient**: Good for large data volumes
- ❌ **Key Distribution Problem**: How to share key securely?
- ❌ **Scalability Issue**: N users = N(N-1)/2 keys needed

**Security Provided**:
- ✅ Confidentiality
- ❌ **NO** non-repudiation (both parties have same key)

**Common Algorithms**:
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard) - DEPRECATED
- 3DES (Triple DES)
- Blowfish, Twofish
- RC4 (stream cipher) - DEPRECATED

**Best Use Cases**:
- Encrypting large amounts of data
- Disk encryption
- Database encryption
- When key sharing is already solved

**Exam Keyword**: "Symmetric = Same key = Shared secret = Fast"

---

### **Asymmetric Encryption** 🔑🔓

**Definition**: Uses TWO mathematically related keys (key pair)

**Also Called**: Public key cryptography

**The Key Pair**:
- **Public Key**: Shared openly, anyone can have it
- **Private Key**: Kept secret, never shared

**How It Works**:
```
Confidentiality:
  Alice encrypts with Bob's PUBLIC key → Bob decrypts with his PRIVATE key

Non-Repudiation/Authentication:
  Alice encrypts with her PRIVATE key → Anyone decrypts with Alice's PUBLIC key
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Solves key distribution**: No shared secret needed
- ✅ **Scalability**: N users = 2N keys (each has key pair)
- ✅ **Non-repudiation**: Private key proves identity
- ❌ **SLOW**: 100-1000x slower than symmetric

**Security Provided**:
- ✅ Confidentiality (encrypt with public, decrypt with private)
- ✅ Authentication (encrypt with private, decrypt with public)
- ✅ Integrity (via digital signatures)
- ✅ Non-repudiation (private key proves identity)

**Common Algorithms**:
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- Diffie-Hellman (key exchange only)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)

**Best Use Cases**:

1. Use **asymmetric** to exchange a symmetric session key
2. Use **symmetric** for actual data encryption

**Example - HTTPS/TLS**:
```
1. Browser and server perform asymmetric key exchange (RSA/ECDHE)
2. They agree on a symmetric session key (AES)
3. All data transferred using fast symmetric encryption (AES)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Security of asymmetric
- ✅ Speed of symmetric
- ✅ Best of both worlds!

**Real-World Use**: Nearly ALL secure communications (HTTPS, VPN, SSH)

## Hashing

### What is Hashing?

**Definition**: One-way cryptographic function producing unique fixed-size digest

**Key Properties**:
1. **One-way**: Can't reverse (hash → original data)
2. **Deterministic**: Same input = same hash
3. **Fixed size**: Any input → fixed output size
4. **Unique**: Different inputs → different hashes (ideally)
5. **Avalanche effect**: Tiny change → completely different hash

**NOT Encryption**: Can't decrypt a hash!

**Purpose**:
- ✅ Verify integrity (file unchanged)
- ✅ Store passwords (hash instead of plaintext)
- ✅ Digital signatures (hash + encrypt)
- ✅ Blockchain (linking blocks)

---

**Example**:
```
User1: password123 + salt_abc123 → Hash_X
User2: password123 + salt_xyz789 → Hash_Y
```

**Critical**: Store salt WITH hash (not secret, just unique)

---

#### **Key Stretching**

- **How**: Apply hash function many times (thousands of rounds)
- **Result**: Slow brute-force attacks significantly
- **Minimum**: 128-bit output

**Algorithms**:
- PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
- bcrypt
- scrypt

**Example**: Hash password 10,000 times instead of once

---

#### **Nonce (Number Used Once)**
- **What**: Unique random number for each operation
- **Use**: Prevent replay attacks
- **How**: Include in authentication exchange
- **Result**: Old captured data can't be reused

**Example - Authentication**:
1. Server sends nonce
2. Client: Hash(password + nonce)
3. Server verifies
4. Nonce expires (can't replay)

---

### Hash Attacks

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1
**Question**: A company needs to encrypt a 500GB database. Which encryption type should they use and why?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: Symmetric encryption (AES-256)

**Explanation**:
- Large data volume = need speed
- Symmetric is 100-1000x faster than asymmetric
- AES-256 is current standard
- Key distribution not an issue (database server has the key)

**NOT asymmetric**: Too slow for 500GB of data
</details>

### Scenario 2
**Question**: A developer wants to verify that a downloaded software file hasn't been tampered with. The vendor provides an MD5 hash. What's the security concern?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: MD5 is broken and vulnerable to collision attacks

**Explanation**:
- MD5 has known collision vulnerabilities
- Attacker could create malicious file with same MD5 hash
- Should use SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead
- MD5 is fine for non-security checksums but NOT for integrity verification

**Better approach**: Vendor should provide SHA-256 hash
</details>

---

### Scenario 3
**Question**: A web application stores credit card numbers. Compliance requires protecting this data. What cryptographic technique should be used?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: Tokenization

**Explanation**:
- Payment card data = perfect tokenization use case
- PCI DSS compliance
- Reduces scope (tokens in system, real data in vault)
- No decryption key to steal (lookup required)

**Could also encrypt**: But tokenization is PCI DSS best practice for payments

**NOT masking**: Masking is for display/testing, not storage

## CompTIA-Style Practice Questions

### Question 1
Which of the following BEST describes the difference between encryption and hashing?

A. Encryption is reversible; hashing is one-way  
B. Hashing is reversible; encryption is one-way  
C. Both are reversible with the correct key  
D. Neither is reversible

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A. Encryption is reversible; hashing is one-way**

**Explanation**:
- **Encryption**: Plaintext → Ciphertext → Plaintext (reversible with key)
- **Hashing**: Data → Hash (NOT reversible, one-way function)

**Purpose difference**:
- Encryption: Confidentiality (hide data)
- Hashing: Integrity (verify unchanged)

This is a fundamental concept - know this cold for the exam!

### Question 2
A company wants to securely exchange encryption keys over the internet without a pre-shared secret. Which algorithm should they use?

A. AES  
B. 3DES  
C. Diffie-Hellman  
D. SHA-256

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C. Diffie-Hellman**

**Explanation**:
- Key exchange without pre-shared secret = Diffie-Hellman
- DH specifically designed for this purpose
- Allows two parties to agree on shared key over insecure channel

**Why not others**:
- A/B: Symmetric algorithms (need shared key first)
- D: Hashing algorithm (not for key exchange)

**Keywords**: "Exchange keys" + "no pre-shared secret" → Diffie-Hellman
</details>

---

### Question 3
Which of the following provides the STRONGEST security for symmetric encryption?

A. DES with 56-bit key  
B. 3DES with 168-bit key  
C. AES with 256-bit key  
D. RC4 with 128-bit key

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C. AES with 256-bit key**

**Explanation**:
- AES-256 = Current gold standard
- Strongest option listed
- No known practical attacks

**Why others are weaker**:
- A: DES is obsolete (easily broken)
- B: 3DES being deprecated
- D: RC4 is broken (multiple vulnerabilities)

**Exam tip**: When in doubt, AES is usually the right answer!
</details>

### Question 4
A security administrator wants to verify that a password hasn't been compromised in a data breach. The password database stores hashed passwords. What additional security measure would make passwords more resistant to rainbow table attacks?

A. Increase hash iterations  
B. Add salt to passwords before hashing  
C. Use longer passwords  
D. Implement account lockout

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B. Add salt to passwords before hashing**

**Explanation**:
- **Salting** = Adding random data before hashing
- Each password gets unique salt
- Same password = different hashes (different salts)
- Rainbow tables useless (pre-computed for unsalted hashes)

**Why others help but don't solve rainbow tables**:
- A: Key stretching (helps, but salt is more direct answer)
- C: Good practice, but doesn't stop rainbow tables
- D: Prevents brute force, not rainbow tables

**Rainbow table attack**: Pre-computed hash lookup table
**Defense**: Salting makes pre-computation impossible (unique per password)
</details>

### Question 5 (Multi-select)
Which TWO cryptographic solutions would be MOST appropriate for protecting data at rest on a company laptop? (Choose TWO)

A. TLS  
B. IPSec  
C. TPM  
D. BitLocker  
E. SSH

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answers: C. TPM and D. BitLocker**

**Explanation**:
- **Data at rest** = Stored data (hard drive)
- **BitLocker** = Full disk encryption (Windows)
- **TPM** = Hardware chip storing encryption keys

**Together**: BitLocker encrypts drive, TPM secures keys

**Why not others** (all for data in transit):
- A: TLS = HTTPS, secure web
- B: IPSec = VPN tunnels
- E: SSH = Secure remote access

**Keywords**: "Data at rest" + "laptop" → Full disk encryption (BitLocker) + Hardware security (TPM)

## Common Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Confusing Encryption and Hashing
❌ **WRONG**: "Hash the data to keep it confidential"  
✅ **RIGHT**: "Encrypt for confidentiality, hash for integrity"

**Remember**: Hashing is ONE-WAY (can't reverse)

---

### Trap 2: "Symmetric is Always Better"
❌ **WRONG**: "Use symmetric because it's faster"  
✅ **RIGHT**: Consider the use case (large data = symmetric, key exchange = asymmetric)

**Context matters!**

---

### Trap 3: MD5/SHA-1 Are Still OK
❌ **WRONG**: "MD5 is fine for checksums"  
✅ **RIGHT**: MD5/SHA-1 are broken for security (use SHA-256+)

**Exam assumes security context**

---

### Trap 4: Diffie-Hellman Encrypts Data
❌ **WRONG**: "Use Diffie-Hellman to encrypt the message"  
✅ **RIGHT**: Diffie-Hellman is for KEY EXCHANGE only

**DH ≠ Encryption algorithm**

---

### Trap 5: TPM = HSM
❌ **WRONG**: "TPM and HSM are the same thing"  
✅ **RIGHT**: 
- TPM = Consumer devices, built-in, lower cost
- HSM = Enterprise, dedicated, high security, expensive

**Different scale and purpose**

## Key Takeaways for Exam Day

1. **Know the three data states**: At rest, in transit, in use
2. **Symmetric = Fast, same key**: AES is the standard
3. **Asymmetric = Slow, key pairs**: RSA/ECC for key exchange and signatures
4. **Hashing = One-way, integrity**: SHA-256 is standard, MD5/SHA-1 broken
5. **Hybrid approach** = Real-world (asymmetric key exchange + symmetric data encryption)
6. **PKI manages certificates**: CA issues, RA verifies, CRL/OCSP for revocation
7. **TPM = Consumer hardware crypto**: BitLocker, secure boot
8. **HSM = Enterprise hardware crypto**: High-security, mission-critical
9. **Salting prevents rainbow tables**: Add random data before hashing
10. **Quantum threat = Post-quantum crypto needed**: NIST standards emerging

**Pro Tip**: When you see "appropriate cryptographic solution," think:
- Large data → Symmetric (AES)
- Key exchange → Asymmetric (DH, RSA, ECC)
- Integrity → Hashing (SHA-256)
- Passwords → Salted hashes + key stretching
- Certificates → PKI
