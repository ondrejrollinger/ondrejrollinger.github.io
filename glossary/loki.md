# Loki

**Definition:** Loki is a log aggregation system that indexes labels for efficient querying while storing raw log lines separately.  
**Why it matters (security):** Centralized, queryable logs accelerate detection, investigations, and correlation across systems, but depend on consistent labeling and retention hygiene.
