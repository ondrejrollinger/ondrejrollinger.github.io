# DNS

**Definition:** The Domain Name System maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses and other records so clients can locate services.  
**Why it matters (security):** DNS is a common chokepoint and visibility layer; tampering, spoofing, or misconfiguration can redirect users or hide malicious infrastructure, so monitoring and hardening DNS is a core defensive control.
